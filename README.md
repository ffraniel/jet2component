## Prerequisites

To complete this you will need to have Git and NPM installed.

To check if git is installed on your machine please enter the following commitng in your terminal window:

```git -v```

If you do not already have git installed on your machine please follow this guide --> https://git-scm.com/ .

## Project Setup

Git clone the project to your computer

```git clone https://github.com/ffraniel/jet2component.git```

To serve the files i have being using the NPM project Static Server (https://www.npmjs.com/package/static-server) which i have installed globally on my computer.

To get this type

```npm i static-server``` 

for a global install add the '-g' flag.

Use your command line interface to change directory into the project folder. Then type

```static-server```

The project will launch on localport:9080. 

I have made the component accept an input value to determine whether the booking was successfully placed or if an error occured. The successful outcome looks as does the image sent through. The error message version changes the text and the icon to indicate an error has occured.

Thanks for looking.
